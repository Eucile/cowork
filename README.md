### Description

This website is designed for a new company hoping to attract clients and organizations interested in renting a shared workspace. Their website should differentiate itself from standard coworking environments in that it has spunk, special amenities, interior design that reflects their personality as a company, and an understanding and appreciation for both technical and creative work. My vision for this website is to show a place that is both productive and kind, a space removed from the office florescence, elegant but not elitist or ultra-corporate.


### User Stories

# Vlad:

    Needs:  
      Vlad is a traveling businessman who needs a calm workspace to focus and complete his work without sacrificing the human contact he would normally experience with his native coworkers.


    Pain Points:
      Isolation, caffein addiction and frequent flyer points have frayed Vlad's nerves. He'd like to find a co-working space especially inclusive to all kinds of workers, but that would also supply his caffein habit.  

    How I Can Help:
      Show a clear mission statement and demonstrate the company's personality using the right visuals, language and easy-to-use web navigation. This will show Vlad that our offices are both friendly, but not so much that it detracts from our clients need to focus. Also, coffee and crafts if he's feeling froggy.

# Katlyn

    Needs:
      Sociability, communal enrichment (like yoga, craft events, etc.)

    Pain Points:
      Katy is not head-over-heels in love with her line of work as of now, so it's very important that she is surrounded by positive people and lovely surroundings to compensate for what her work fails to give her.

    How I Can Help:
      Show her that our space can offer all of the things lacking in her current experience. Community, love (as the neon sign offers), and the occasional recreational distractions on Thursdays that will keep her motivated and engaged socially throughout the week.


# Local Companies

    Needs:
      A warm place to facilitate their employees that keeps them busy but happy, somewhere that differs from the stringent and cold corporate world.

    Pain Points:
      Apathy among some of their staff and a lack of outside enrichment and certain comforts and amenities.  

    How I Can Help:
      Demonstrate that our offices come ready-made with all the human touches, interior design and colorful amenities that perhaps their old offices were lacking or did not think to invest in.

### Brainstorming and Inspiration

  Precursory research on why coworking exists and what draws companies to it. I also looked at the big companies who specialize in it, trying to find a place to pivot from and form a new niche.
