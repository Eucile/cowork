This website aims to attract clients and organizations interested in


### User Stories

* Vlad:
    Needs:  
      Vlad is a traveling businessman who needs a calm workspace to focus and complete his work without sacrificing the human contact he would normally experience with his native coworkers.
    Pain Points:
      Isolation, and frequent flyer points have frayed Vlad's nerves. He'd like to find a co-working space especially inclusive to all kinds of workers.
    How I Can Help:
      Show a clear mission statement and demonstrate the company's personality using the right visuals, language and easy-to-use web navigation. This will show Vlad that our offices are both friendly, but not so much that it detracts from our clients need to focus.

* Katy
    Needs:
      Sociability, communal enrichment (like yoga, craft events, etc.)
    Pain Points:
      Katy is not head-over-heels in love with her line of work as of now, so it's very important that she is surrounded by positive people and lovely surroundings to compensate for what her work lacks.
    How I Can Help:
      Show her that our offices can offer all of the things lacking in her current experience. Community, love (as the neon sign offers), and the occasional recreational distractions (Thursdays) that will keep her motivated and excited throughout the week.


* Local Companies
    Needs: A warm place to facilitate their employees that keeps them busy but happy, somewhere that differs from the stringent and cold corporate world.
    Pain Points: Apathy among some of their staff and a lack of outside enrichment and certain amenities.  
    How I Can Help: Demonstrate that our offices come ready-made with all the human touches, interior design and colorful amenities that perhaps their old offices were lacking.
